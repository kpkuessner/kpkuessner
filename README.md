### Hi, I’m @kpkuessner ✌️ 

I Work as a front-end developer with UI/UX design skills. I'm based in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany.

Since 1998 I've been living and breathing desktop development and creating modern and user friendly interfaces. 
I've had the chance to immerse myself in many different works and projects, helping to make this world a little 
better through design & code.

### 👨‍💻 What I'm focusing on...

I am continuously expanding my knowledge of software development and work with Swift & SwiftUI for native iOS/macOS applications, C# & .NET for cross-platform solutions, Blazor for modern web applications, and Python for versatile development tasks. With my experience in UI/UX design, I develop applications that are not only functional but also intuitive to use. For an efficient development process, I use tools such as Radzen and JetBrains Rider.<br />
